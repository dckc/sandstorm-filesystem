WIP CapNProto filesystem schema + example sandstorm apps

# Why

File(system) access is a common enough need that many Sandstorm apps end
up bundling their own file manager UI, and there's a lot of duplication.
It would be better if there was a standard schema that apps could use to
allow one another access to files.

# What

This repo contains a work-in-progress schema that can be requested &
offered via the powerbox, plus some example apps.
